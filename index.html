      <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.<br><br>
        First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p>

      <p>Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully and study how it interacts with the park’s ecosystems. This blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for <span style="font-weight: 900;">current fire restrictions.</span></p>

      <p>We strongly recommend that you make reservations for lodging, camping, and backpacking. You can pay the <span>park entrance fee upon arrival</span> (there's no need to pay it in advance).</p>
